# Demographic Mapper

## Background

During my first Hackathon we were given what seemed to be large amounts of census data with the goal to create an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) of how we would use this data to help businesses better target their demographic.
I decided to take on the challenge a few days later solo from scratch and this is what I have came up with so far.
NOTE: Currently their is no online data to use this application with possibly in the future. (I have millions of records and I will find the smallest one later to upload and be used for demo)

## Technology Used

* MongoDB
* Express
* Bootstrap

## Summary

I working for about 7 hours (till the sun came up >.<) getting it to the point is as right now.
Google maps was easy enough to learn and I felt like this was a good practice in MongoDB as well.
I had data points printing on Google maps in about 2 hours but the real fun begun when I matched up many different filters within the query.
Also inserting mass amount of data points (well over 5 million just for NJ) into mongo with node was also a great learning opportunity.
I got to learn a bit more about the limits of node and what are better implementation of the same tasks such as reading mass data.
Overall I loved this mini project and will make it into a true working demo in the future as I think this kind of data visualization is awesome.
