# Demographic Mapper

## During my first Hackathon we were given what seemed to be 8GB of census data with the goal to create an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) of how we would use this data to help businesses better target their demographic.

## I decided to take on the challenge a few days later solo and this is what I have came up with so far.

### NOTE: Currently their is no online data to use this application with possibly in the future. (I have millions of records and I will find the smallest one later to upload and be used for demo)
